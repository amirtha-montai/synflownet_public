The building blocks are available upon request from [enamine.net/building-blocks/building-blocks-catalog](https://enamine.net/building-blocks/building-blocks-catalog), Global stock. We filtered the molecules based on size (maximum 20 heavy atoms) and matching with our templates. From here we selected _n_ random building blocks (using `subsample_building_blocks.py`), sanitized them using `sanitize_building_blocks.py` and removed duplicates. After preprocessing, make sure that the file names match those in `src/gflownet/tasks/config.py`.
